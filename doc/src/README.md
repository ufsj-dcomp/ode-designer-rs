# ODE-Designer

**ODE-Designer** was developed in the context of a FAPEMIG research project by postgraduate students and undergraduate students in Computer Science at the [Federal University of São João Del-Rei](https://ufsj.edu.br).

The main objective of ODE-Designer is to facilitate the creation, implementation and simulation of Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) models. The software can be applied to research and teaching-learning of Computational Modeling.

Through a visually intuitive graphical user interface (GUI), ODE-Designer allows users to conceptualize and "draw" mathematical models, while the software automatically generates the requisite implementation, simulation, and result visualization code. A distinguished feature of the software is the model's visual representation. It is designed to be intuitive and easy to use.
